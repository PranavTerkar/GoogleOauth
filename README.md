I am updating you on the progress I have made on the Google OAuth implementation in our React application. I have successfully integrated the necessary libraries, such as google-auth2 and jwt-decode, to handle the authentication process.

The React application now includes a Google login feature, allowing users to securely log in using their Google accounts. Once authenticated, the application retrieves the user's authentication information and displays it in both encoded and decoded forms in the browser console.

To achieve this, I utilized the GoogleOAuthProvider component provided by the google-auth2 library. By passing the appropriate client ID, obtained from the Google Developers Console, to the component, we can establish a connection with Google's OAuth service. When a user successfully logs in, the authentication response is captured, and the jwt-decode library is used to decode the received authentication token, providing us with useful user information.

I have also added error handling to handle cases where the login process fails, ensuring that appropriate feedback is logged in the console.

I have generated an authentication token using Postman.
